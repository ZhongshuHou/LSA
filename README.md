# Local Spectral Attention
This repository conduct ablation studies on local attention (a.k.a band attention) applied in full-band spectrum, namely local spectral attention (LSA). Two full-band speech enhancement (SE) models with spectral attention replace the conventional attention (a global manner) with LSA that only looks at adjacent bands at a certain frequency (a local manner). One model is our previous work called DPARN, whose source code can be found in
