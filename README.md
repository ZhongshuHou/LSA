# Local Spectral Attention
This repository conduct ablation studies on local attention (a.k.a band attention) applied in full-band spectrum, namely local spectral attention (LSA). Two full-band speech enhancement (SE) models with spectral attention replace the conventional attention (a global manner) with LSA that only looks at adjacent bands at a certain frequency (a local manner). One model is our previous work called DPARN, whose source code can be found in   
https://github.com/Qinwen-Hu/dparn.   
The other model is the Multi-Scale Temporal Frequency with Axial Attention (MTFAA) network, which ranked 1st in the DNS-4 challenge for full-band SE. Here we release an unofficial pytorch implementation of MTFAA as well as its modification.
